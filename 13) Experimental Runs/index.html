							<h4><u>Conclusion</u></h4>
							It is seen that the performance of the Self-checkout is generally better than that of the Cashier.</br>
							<br>
							1) The mean service time for the cashier is longer than that of the self-checkout </br>
							2) The mean waiting time for the cashier is longer than that of the self-checkout </br>
							3) The overall time spent in system is significantly longer for the cashier as compared to the self-checkout </br>
							<br>
							=> Allocate more customers to the self-checkout queue</br>
							<br>
							Using our simulation, we hope to see if the Self Checkout queue also results in a lower average queuing and service time than the cashier queue.

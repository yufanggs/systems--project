				<h2>t-test</h2>
				t-test is done on excel for both service time and time spent in queue of the customers. This is to test if it is statistically significant that both the average
				<br>service time and average time customers spent in queue between the Cashier and Self-Checkout are different.
				<br>
				<br>H0:μ1 -μ2 =0
				<br>H1: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0
				<br>
				<br>At 5% level of significance
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>μ1 refers to the mean waiting time in queue for the cashier queue
				<br>μ2 refers to the mean waiting time in queue for the self-checkout queue
				<br>
				<br>Below are the results of the t-test
				<br>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<h3><u> Service Time </u></h3>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>If t-statistics is greater than t-critical in a two tail test, we reject null hypothesis. For service time test results, according to table 1, t Stat is 109.79 which is greater than the t critical two tail of 1.9647. Therefore, we reject the
					<br>null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the mean service time of cashier queue to be different from the mean service time of the self-checkout queue.

						<h3><u> Time Spent In Queue </u></h3>

						<br>
						<br>
						<br> The same is done for the t-test of time spent in queue. The t Stat is 76.297, which is also larger than the t critical two-tail of 1.966. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis
						<br>and conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the mean time spent in cashier queue to be different from the mean time spent in self-checkout queue.

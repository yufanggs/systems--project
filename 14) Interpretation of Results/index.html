				<h2>Interpretation of Results</h2>
				<h4><u>Conclusion</h4></u>

				Our results show that there is an efficient use to technology to improve the grocery shopping experience of customers in terms of the queueing and payment processes.
				<br>More shoppers with baskets should be allocated to the self checkout queues whenever possible to minimise queueing and service times.</br>
				<br>
				Our results are not surprising to us as customers with baskets (with lesser items) are only allowed to go to the self checkout queue. Also, self checkout servers take a shorter service time
				<br>than cashiers would probably be due to the fact that they handle only cashless payments while cashiers are required to handle cash on some transactions, which may result in a longer service time due to the manual processing required.
				<br>
				<br>However, there are still some improvements that can be done for this simulation.</br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br><b><u>Improvement 1: Add more cashier and self checkout servers</b></br></u>
				<br>
				<br>
				This simulation was based on the context of a small-scale supermarket with 1 cashier counter and 2 self checkout servers.
				<br>This may not be accurate as most supermarkets have more than 1 cashier counters as well as more than 2 self checkout servers (e.g. supermarkets at common heartland malls).
				<br>One improvement that can be made for this simulation would be to include more servers -- both cashier counters and self checkout servers, in order to have a more realistic simulation of supermarkets.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br><b><u>Improvement 2: Consider amount of groceries purchased</b></u></br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Although this simulation differentiates between individuals that use trolleys and baskets, it does not actually factor in the amount of groceries bought.
				<br>For example, shoppers who use baskets tend to purchase a smaller amount of groceries as compared to shoppers who purchase a larger amount of groceries, who tend to use trolleys.
				<br>This would naturally mean that shoppers who use baskets would generally have a shorter service time as compared to those who use trolleys.
				<br>However, in the event that customers with a large amount of groceries use a basket while customers with a small amount of groceries use a trolley, it is no longer safe to assume that the service time
				<br>pattern remains. Therefore, we propose that an additional variable, “Amount of Groceries Purchased” to be added into future analysis to obtain more accurate queueing statistics.
